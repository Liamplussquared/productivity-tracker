# Simple Productivity Tracker

This simple GUI app allows for periods of work to be tracked via a spotwatch interface. You can specify what you're doing in the text field. There are three timers displayed, one showing the total amount of time spent being productive in the current week, another showing the current time spent today, and the final one showing the current run of the stopwatch.
